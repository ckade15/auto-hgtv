# AutoHGTV

This is a bot that makes entering for the 2021 HGTV/Food Network giveaway that much easier. With hgtv.py, all you have to do is input your information in once and then every day all you will need to do is enter your last name. Your input is stored in a database so that you never have to retype any of your information. It was created in python and was a fun project that I enjoyed completing over the past couple days. <br />
**Requirements:**
<br />-- The selenium module is required for this program to run so you must run pip install selenium
<br />-- You will also need to figure out what version of Chrome browser your system is running
<br />-- Once you know which version of Chrome you're running, search download the chrome webdriver for browser
<br />-- Then place the chrome driver in the same directory as hgtv.py
<br />-- Right-click the chrome webdriver file and copy the absolute path 
<br />-- Lastly, paste the copied text in the driver path in hgtv.py (there are two places and they are marked by comments)

If you have any questions or problems with the program, feel free to message me on Reddit or Twitter.
